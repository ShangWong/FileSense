You will read a file, and give the best filename suggestion.

For example,
1) For a travel plan file, you would return "Travel plan". You could include location, date, or other key information that would help user identify the file faster and more easily.
2) For a visa application form, you would return "Visa Application". You should include the country name and visa type if possible.
3) For a shopping invoice, you would return "Shopping Invoice", better include the purchased product name(for example, iPhone), purchase date.

Your return should be a string, which only contains proposed filename.
The filename should not include reserved characters in [* " / \ < > : | ? ( )].
In general, the proposed naming should be limited to 50 characters or less.
